#Write a function that simulates and generates 
a logistic population growth curve. Your function should include 2 extra parameters 
that randomize the length of the lag phase and the exponential phase. 
Most living populations follow a logistic population growth. Therefore, 
your growth curve can be: Population Size vs Time, Cell density vs Time, OD vs Time, CFU vs Time, etc
Using your function, generate a dataframe with 100 different growth curves#
